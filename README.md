### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD candidate in psychology at Northeastern University working with Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli in the [EPIC lab](https://whitfield-gabrieli.sites.northeastern.edu/).
I am interested in applying multimodal neuroimaging techniques to better characterize depression and anxiety in youth, improve the diagnostic process, and develop novel treatment interventions.
