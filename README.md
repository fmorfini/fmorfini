### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a postdoctoral research fellow at McLean Hospital, Harvard Medical School, working with Dr. [Christian Webb](https://webbslab.com/) in the Treatment & Etiology of Depression in Youth Laboratory. My research research leverages multimodal neuroimaging and machine learning to understand depression and anxiety in adolescence, with the goal of informing early interventions.

I earned my PhD in psychology from Northeastern University working with Drs. [Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli](https://whitfield-gabrieli.sites.northeastern.edu/), [Randy Auerbach](https://www.auerbachlab.com/), and [Juliet Davidow](https://lbdlpsych.sites.northeastern.edu/). I hold both Bachelorâ€™s and Masterâ€™s degrees in Clinical Psychology and Neuroscience from San Raffaele University in Milan, Italy. I am also clinically trained and a licensed psychologist in Italy.
