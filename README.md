### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a PhD candidate in psychology at Northeastern University working with Susan Whitfield-Gabrieli in the [EPIC lab](https://whitfield-gabrieli.sites.northeastern.edu/). 
\
My research focuses on applying multimodal neuroimaging techniques to better characterize depression and anxiety in adolescents, predict future symptom change, and develop novel treatment interventions.
